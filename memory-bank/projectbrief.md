# AI Image Captioning/Tagging Tool Project Brief

## Objective
Create a visually impressive and easy-to-use web application that demonstrates AI image captioning and tagging capabilities using React and HuggingFace's free pre-trained models.

## Core Requirements
1. Drag-and-drop interface for easy image upload
2. Instant AI analysis results (captions and tags)
3. Clean, modern user interface
4. Utilization of pre-trained AI models (no training required)

## Key Features
- Image upload via drag-and-drop or file selection
- Image captioning using the BLIP model
- Image tagging using the ResNet-50 model
- Real-time feedback on analysis progress
- Clear display of generated captions and tags

## User Experience Goals
- Simple, intuitive interface
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Clear visual feedback during processing
- Organized presentation of results
- Minimal learning curve

## Technical Constraints
- Use of React for the frontend
- HuggingFace API for AI model integration
- No backend server required (direct API calls)
- Must handle various image formats and sizes
- Must gracefully handle API errors and rate limits

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully upload images
- Application consistently generates relevant captions and tags
- Interface remains responsive and user-friendly
- Application works without requiring complex setup or configuration
