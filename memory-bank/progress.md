# Progress: AI Image Captioning/Tagging Tool

## What Works
- ✅ Project setup with Vite, React, and TypeScript
- ✅ Tailwind CSS configuration for styling
- ✅ Basic application structure and component hierarchy
- ✅ Image upload functionality with drag-and-drop interface
- ✅ Image preview after upload
- ✅ HuggingFace API integration for image captioning
- ✅ HuggingFace API integration for image tagging
- ✅ Loading states during API calls
- ✅ Error handling for API failures
- ✅ Responsive design for different screen sizes
- ✅ Environment variable support for API keys

## What's Left to Build
- ⬜ Image optimization before API submission
- ⬜ Caching mechanism for API results
- ⬜ Rate limit handling for API calls
- ⬜ Enhanced error recovery
- ⬜ Unit tests for components
- ⬜ Integration tests for API calls
- ⬜ Accessibility improvements
- ⬜ Support for analyzing multiple images
- ⬜ Advanced styling enhancements
- ⬜ Performance optimizations

## Current Status
The application is in a **functional prototype** state. Users can:
1. Upload images through drag-and-drop or file selection
2. See a preview of their uploaded image
3. Get AI-generated captions describing the image
4. See AI-generated tags identifying objects and concepts in the image

The core functionality is working, but there are opportunities for enhancement in terms of performance, user experience, and error handling.

## Known Issues
1. **API Token Security**: API token is currently stored in environment variables, which is not ideal for production
2. **No Image Optimization**: Large images may take longer to process and increase API usage
3. **Limited Error Handling**: API error handling could be more robust
4. **No Caching**: Repeated analysis of the same image makes duplicate API calls
5. **HuggingFace Rate Limits**: No handling for API rate limit errors

## Next Priorities
1. Implement image optimization to improve performance
2. Add caching mechanism to reduce API calls
3. Enhance error handling and recovery
4. Add unit tests for components
5. Improve accessibility
