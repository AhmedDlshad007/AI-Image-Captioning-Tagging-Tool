# Technical Context: AI Image Captioning/Tagging Tool

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React** (v18+): JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **React Dropzone**: For drag-and-drop file upload functionality
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the HuggingFace API

### AI Models (via HuggingFace Inference API)
- **BLIP Image Captioning Model** (Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large): Generates descriptive captions
- **ResNet-50** (microsoft/resnet-50): Identifies objects and concepts in images

## Development Setup
- Node.js environment (v14+)
- Package management via npm
- Environment variables for API keys
- Local development server via Vite

## Technical Constraints
- **Client-side only**: No backend server required
- **API rate limits**: HuggingFace free tier has usage limitations
- **Browser compatibility**: Must work on modern browsers
- **Image processing**: Limited to browser capabilities
- **Responsive design**: Must work on various screen sizes

## Dependencies
All dependencies are managed through npm and are listed in package.json. Key dependencies include:
- react, react-dom: Core React libraries
- react-dropzone: For file upload functionality
- axios: For API requests
- tailwindcss: For styling

## API Integration
The application uses the HuggingFace Inference API, which requires:
- An API token stored in the .env file
- Base64 encoding of images for transmission
- Handling of asynchronous responses
- Error handling for failed requests
- Rate limit consideration

## Performance Considerations
- Image size optimization before sending to API
- Caching of API responses for repeated analyses
- Optimized rendering of UI components
- Lazy loading of non-critical components

## Security Notes
- API tokens should be kept secure and not committed to version control
- Users should be aware of data transmission to third-party APIs
- No user data is stored persistently
