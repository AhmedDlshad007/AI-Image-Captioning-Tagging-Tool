# Active Context: AI Image Captioning/Tagging Tool

## Current Focus
The project is currently in its initial implementation phase. We've set up the basic structure of the application including:
- Project scaffolding with Vite and React
- Component structure (App, ImageUploader, ImageAnalysis)
- UI styling with Tailwind CSS
- HuggingFace API integration for image captioning and tagging

## Recent Changes
- Created the basic React application structure
- Implemented the drag-and-drop image upload functionality
- Added image captioning and tagging using HuggingFace models
- Created responsive UI with loading and error states
- Added environment variable support for API keys

## Next Steps
1. **Enhance error handling**: Improve error messages and recovery mechanisms
2. **Add image optimization**: Compress/resize images before sending to API to improve performance
3. **Implement caching**: Cache API results to avoid duplicate requests
4. **Add unit tests**: Create tests for components and utility functions
5. **Improve accessibility**: Ensure the application meets accessibility standards
6. **Add more models**: Integrate additional HuggingFace models for enhanced analysis

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **API Key Security**: Currently using environment variables for API keys, but need to consider more secure options for production
- **Rate Limiting**: Need to implement handling for HuggingFace API rate limits
- **Performance Optimization**: Consider optimizing image size before sending to API
- **Error Handling**: Improve the user experience when API calls fail
- **Mobile Experience**: Further optimize for smaller screens

## Current Questions
- What additional features would provide the most value with minimal complexity?
- How can we optimize the application for low-bandwidth connections?
- What's the best approach to handle API rate limits for a better user experience?
- Should we add support for analyzing multiple images at once?

## Development Environment
- Running on local development server with `npm run dev`
- Environment variables set up for API keys
- Tailwind CSS configured for styling
